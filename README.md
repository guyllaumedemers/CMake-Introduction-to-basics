# CMake, Introduction to basics

### Using a build system and why it matters.

A build system is a broad term that groups together a set of tools used to generally compile and link source code, but it can also include auxiliary tools used during a build process.

#### Project

Example details are grouped into subject related points and showcase investigation result on the subject of libraries. Further details will be provided on more advance features that are covered in the making of our examples.

#### What this README.md is not

Be aware that some of the tooling used in the making of this `Demo` project won't be covered here. External documentations will be provided for your own benefit, which in most case, are also where most of the information mentioned here will be coming from.

## What's a build system

**Wikipedia** : "Build automation is the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests."

### What's a build system generator

**Wikipedia** : "[CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) is cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent method. CMake is not a build system itself; it generates another system's build files. It can invoke native build environments such as Make, Qt Creator, Ninja, Android Studio, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio."
